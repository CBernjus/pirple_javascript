# Assignment 9

In my project I already dynamically loaded almost all of my texts dynamically.
Because of that I didn't really understood why I should substitute the remaining texts in the original HTML file with template literals.

Therefore I challenged myself by writing a little script that will break down all tags in the HTML body and will substitute them with their representation as template strings in a javascript file.

This Assignment contains my original code from the first project in this course, the processed HTML with the literals.js file as well as the my python script.

    - The Python script must be in the same location as the html file -

    - By default the script assumes that the html file name is "index.html" -
